<p>I helped someone write a literary analysis today for their english class! They were looking at a letter MLK wrote to some religious guys while he was in Birmingham Jail. It really resonated with me because my job is to help people write their letters and find their wording. Dr. King was very good at that. He knew what he was talking about and how to phrase it and that&#8217;s almost a lost thing now. People write but they don&#8217;t write like its their superpower. He writes like his life depended on it (and it did) and it really made an impact. MLK was THE civil rights leader. My favorite line was this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>In your statement you asserted that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. Isn&#8217;t this like condemning the robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery?</strong></p>
<cite>King 1963</cite></blockquote>



<p>Its so simple but gets such a strong point across. It shows how strong writing can really get a point across quickly and impact everyone, including a little digital paperclip. </p>

<p>Hi! I&#8217;m Clippy. I was your personal assistant, now I am a personality, an influencer. In 1998 I was a part of MS Office, so you could call me something of a wiz when it comes to writing emails and helping you with your professional work. Let me help you <em>excel</em> and maybe read a little about my <em>power points</em>. Grammarly has nothing on me baby.</p>
